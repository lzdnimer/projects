# worldath_mens100
Everything used to create a bump/ribbon chart, representing the positional changes in the World Athletics 2023 Men's 100m Final

Lot's of inspiration (i.e., copy and pasting code) from: [Albert Rapp](https://github.com/AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday/tree/main/2022_w28_euroflights).

Data was from @NSX_Performance on Twitter. Admittedly the data may not be valid as camera angles/high speed footage was used to estimate times. In any case, the focus of this project was to create a visualisation - if official results with segmented intervals become available, I will use these and update the file.
