# Twilight 5000

## Summary
I took part in a 5K race (finally sub-20!) and wanted to visualise the performances using PowerBI. Data was accessed via API using R. Full details in the markdown file.

Data from Opentrack, lots of guidance from [Dean Chereden's](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeanChereden) YouTube channel.

This folder includes:
1. The guide I made on accessing API's using R (.rmd, .html, and two .png's)
2. The dashboard I made using PowerBI (plus screenshots)

Hit me up if you have questions, suggestions, feedback, or just want to talk about how Scottish athletes carry Team GB
