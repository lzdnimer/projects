# projects
A collection of my data-related projects, primarily focusing on R to create data visualisations.

Teaching myself (or getting StackOverflow & ChatGPT to teach me) R, Python, and Looker.

## about me
I'm a consultant working for a firm that focuses on helping banks avoid being fined by reviewing their Transaction Monitoring systems to see if:
* Their data flows correctly from point A to B
* There are data quality issues
* The logic they use in detecting suspicious and possibly criminal behaviour works.

I use SQL for 90% of the work carried out. Now I'm learning Python and R to hopefully incorporate them into my work and speed up processes.

Get in touch if you have feedback!
